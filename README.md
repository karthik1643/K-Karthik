The heatmap shows correlations among numeric features in an insurance fraud dataset. All correlation values are weak (mostly between -0.2 and +0.2). fraud_flag has very low correlation with all other variables. days_until_settlement (0.13) slightly correlates with fraud_flag. claim_amount_k and num_previous_claims show a small positive link (0.14). claim_amount_k and claim_id have a weak negative correlation (-0.20). policy_type and policy_holder_age show a minor positive trend (0.18). No strong multicollinearity exists among features. Fraud detection likely depends on non-linear or categorical factors. Use advanced models (e.g., XGBoost) to capture complex fraud patterns. The code analyzes all numeric and categorical columns in the dataset. It first selects numeric features and plots their histograms with KDE curves. These plots help visualize data distribution, detect skewness, and identify outliers. A normal bell shape indicates balanced data, while skewed curves suggest transformation needs. Next, categorical columns are selected and displayed using count plots. These show how frequently each category appears in the data. The visualizations help detect class imbalance or rare categories. This analysis supports better preprocessing and feature engineering. It ensures data readiness before modeling. Overall, it provides a clear understanding of data structure and quality.
